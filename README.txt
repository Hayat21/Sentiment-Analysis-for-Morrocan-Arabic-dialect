CONTEST
This project is about honing our machine learning skills. Given a comment text written in Morrocan Arabic dialect, the task aims at predicting the sentiment of that comment.
DATASET
The training set is not too large and not too small: it consists of 1920 comments, alongside a test set that contains 240 comments.
This dataset has been built using comments and opinions of users from news websites and Social Media about covid19 vaccination.
There are only two classes of sentiment in this dataset which are Negative (0) and Positive(1).
